# The-othello
Othello is a strategy board game for two players (Black and White), played on an 8 by 8 board. The game traditionally begins with four discs placed in the middle of the board as shown below.
Black must place a black disc on the board, in such a way that there is at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new disc and another black disc, with one or more contiguous white pieces between them.
After placing the disc, Black flips all white discs lying on a straight line between the new disc and any existing black discs. All flipped discs are now black.
Now White plays. This player operates under the same rules, with the roles reversed: White lays down a white disc, causing black discs to flip.


The player with the most discs on the board at the end of the game wins. If both players have the same number of discs, then the game is a draw.

This version has been only designed to be played as 2-players mode.
